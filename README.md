# Project Name: Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform

Peddy is a platform designed for adopting pets, connecting animals in need with caring families. It features a simple and beautiful navbar for easy navigation, a colorful banner to showcase available pets, and a footer with helpful links. The main goal of Peddy is to facilitate pet adoption and promote responsible pet ownership. Whether you're looking for a dog, cat, or other small animals, Peddy aims to provide a friendly experience for both pets and their new owners.

## Key Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: Peddy is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

- **View More Button**: The banner features a prominent "View More" button that directs users to the main section of the website, where they can easily browse and find available pets.

- **Category Buttons**: Users can filter their search using four category buttonsâ€”Cats, Birds, Rabbits, and Dogs. Clicking on these buttons displays pets based on their specific categories, making it easy to find the perfect match.

- **Interactive Pet Cards**: Each pet card includes three interactive buttons: "Thumbs Up," "Adopt," and "Details." Users can express their interest with the thumbs-up button, which also adds the liked pet's image to a designated area on the right side of the screen.

- **Detailed Pet Information**: The "Details" button provides comprehensive information about each pet, including breed, age, and vaccination status, helping users make informed decisions.

- **Adoption Confirmation Process**: When users click the "Adopt" button, they are guided through a confirmation process, ensuring a smooth adoption experience while encouraging responsible pet ownership.
